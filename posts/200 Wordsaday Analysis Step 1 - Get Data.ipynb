I think this is a good naminig to alarmingly emphasize how important to have sufficient sleep.</p><p>Today I would like to explain about the concept of sleep debt and how difficult to return this debt.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Why it is a problem?</h3><p>One of the trick characteristics for sleep debt is that we tend not to recognize this cumulative sleep debt. We might think we sleep sufficiently everyday and there is no sleep issue. However, there might be a chance that you do have slightly lower than you need everyday. That difference would be <b>accumulated like a snow ball</b> of financial debt with interest. Without our noticing, our performance of work or chore jobs are decreased. In the worst case, you might be dead due to the mistakes or sickness trigered by lack of sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>One research by University of Pennsylvania (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12683469\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">The cumulative cost of additional wakefulness</a>)&nbsp;showed one intriging result:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The performance of those who stay over the night dropped sharply</li><li>The performance of <b>those who sleep less (6 hours) everyday for 2 weeks</b> eventually became equivalent to the one of <b>those who stay over the night on the 2nd day</b>.</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>How to detect sleep debt?</h3><p>It is actually difficult but if you need to sleep a lot on weekend or your days off, this could be the indicator of sleep debt. Your brain and body thrive to return the sleep debt cumulated during the weekdays.&nbsp;</p><p>To test it, you should sleep in a completely dark room without PC or smartphones\\' screen. When you wake up but still feel like sleepy, sleep again until it goes away. If you observe <b>the increase of sleep time more than 2 hours</b>, you need to re-consider your sleep schedule.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n    ',\n",

If we continue a thing for long enough, we will reach the next level where we can see something different.&nbsp;</p><p>Although I did not have a record-breaking achievement (maybe yet), it has been very helpful for me to play the piano in my life. Since I started to play when I was 5 or 6 years old, I \"<b><i>continued</i></b>\" in a way thanks to my mother.</p><p>My mother wanted me to be interested in playing the piano when I was 5 years old. But she never told me to play the piano. She showed us that she enjoyed herself playing the piano and singing, and let us desire to be involved. We were attracted and gathered around my mother as she aimed.&nbsp;</p><p>When&nbsp; I went to junior high school, I join a basketball club and went to the second school in the evening after the usual school during the day to study advanced areas. I gradually lost some interests and found difficult to continue playing the piano.&nbsp;</p><p>One day I told my mother that I would like to quit. However, gently she asked me this was the only thing she wanted me to continue. She said, \"<b><i>try to continue even if you do not practice</i></b>.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As she suggested, I continued to go and learn from my piano teacher. It was not that bad experience. But literally, I went there without practice and was embarrassed that I did not make any progress.&nbsp;</p><p>After I entered university and was released from the pressure to enter a competitive university, I made great friends through music.&nbsp;I found many other ways of having fun with the piano e.g., accompany for chorus, singing while playing, piano duo, 2 piano with 8 hands, improvise. When I studied abroad,<b> <i>it was a helpful moment to remind of myself by doing an unchanged thing i.e., playing the piano</i></b>.</p><p>Now I still play the piano for fun and relaxing by picking up some scores covering pop or movie songs that I am familiar with. I appreciated the moment that I can just focus on playing and not think of concerns at all–<b><i>white out moment</i></b>.&nbsp;</p><p>Through playing the piano, I learned how to improve my skill. As long as we continue and think of a more effective way of using the time, we try to set a small goal for practice, make experiments in various ways, and see the improvement (or degradation.) These cycle can be applied to anything.&nbsp;</p><p>If we can do one thing, we can have a more decent expectation of how things are going. We cannot expect everything is smoothly going well. But after a while, if we continue long, we will see some signs of progress.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>(Oh, I originally wanted to say something different but it seems to be changed...I need to revise this later)</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",

I remember I was inspired by this book and recommended to some of my friends. So I would like to re-visited the essence of Essentialism and reflect how well I could apply it to my life since then.</p><p><br></p><h3>Key question: <i><b>what is really important now?</b></i>&nbsp;</h3><p>Those who especially can perform well and build a good reputation in terms of work might have a pit hole that all of the efforts are diluted and distributed to different directions. To keep your focus on the important thing, we need to keep asking yourself \"what is really important now?.\" and \"Do less but better\"</p><p><br></p><h3>The Essentialist approach</h3><p>Here are some steps to be more focused and be an essentialist. I find it very similar to \"Konmari Method\", which is a method to tidy up and ask whether it sparks your joy or not.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Explore and Evaluate<br>We need to think carefully and evaluate a broad set of options.&nbsp;</li><li>Eliminate<br>We need to eliminate opportunities and obligations with the courage to make the highest possible contribution towards our goal.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Execute<br>Once we decided which option we take and focus on, we need to create a system or flow to execute our decision with fewer efforts. Also, it is important not to forget including joy in this system.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><br></p><h3>Reflection&nbsp;</h3><p>Now if I look back the past three years of my work as a customer-faced data scientist, it was overall okay to focus on something important for myself. I focused on my commitment and deliverables. But as a team, we tend to lose a focus. We are afraid of betting on one single goal and tried to hedge the risk of failure. As a consultant, it would be a strategy to make customers satisfied, which is one essential goal for us.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, it was hard to focus on my private side. Health, hobbies, family, friends, and life-long learning. Hobbies might be out of scope since it is fun but sometimes I felt like if I should focus on one of them and seek a deeper level in one hobby. In terms of life-long learning, I focus on speaking, writing, and coding. My focus seems to be distributed but I built an almost stable routine for each of them. I saw the progress of each. The question is whether I should focus on one by one or do it in parallel with some weight. I do not know. I believe there is <b><i>a resonance factor</i></b> that one influences on the others among them.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;<br></p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",

It took a while to find out what RFX stands for. The thyroid is located around our neck and controls one of the hormones to slow down or rev up metabolism. T4 is a shorthand form of&nbsp;<b>Thyroxine</b>, which is one of the hormones controlled by the thyroid. There seem to be two types: bound and free T4. Free T4 is less than 1% out of T4 and more important to measure.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>UA W MICROSCOPIC (C&amp;S IF INDICATED)</h3><p>UA stands for <b>U</b>rin<b>a</b>lysis that comes from urine with analysis. C&amp;S means urine <b>C</b>ulture and <b>S</b>ensitivity, which investigate if there are germs or bacteria in your urine.&nbsp; The \"culture\" in this context means a kind of germs group or mob when the growth of germs is promoted in a lab environment.

If the audience is given, you need to understand their needs or issues and provide a solution for them. However, if you write a tutorial or blog for yourself, it might be tricky. Your audience would be yourself or someone who is not considered but happens to have the same issue as the author.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h3>Interesting</h3><p>There are ways to attract people in the beginning if the right people are about reading your tutorial. Not to let them bored, we need to show why they have to read the rest of the tutorial. People need a reason to continue. If the benefit of the tutorial is shown in the beginning, the reader will continue.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other aspect, people actually need to find the meaning by themself to learn something effectively. To make the tutorial more powerful, we need to show the benefit of the tutorial as soon as possible before the reader lose their interest.</p><h3><br>&nbsp;Easy to follow</h3><p>You need to work through each step so that people can easily follow. The reader can also easily skip some of the steps if they know.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Now the question is how to make reasonable steps break-down without missing. Sometimes I feel I did not fully understand the contents. However, to improve it, I need to write and analyze my writing to identify where is a clumsy part in my writing, and need to revise that part.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Let me know if you have any good material about how to write a tutorial or your favorite&nbsp; great tutorials.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n    ',\n",

But it is important to understand the dynamics of sales for running a business. So let\\'s learn how to sell something.&nbsp;</p><h3>Don\\'t say \"please buy\"</h3><p>Do not say \"Please buy it!\" if you are too honest and direct, you would like to say that. However, someone who does not want to buy it at all does not buy by hearing \"please buy it.\" It would lead to the opposed result.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The first step will be to make someone feel like buying it. Before suggesting to buy it, the customer should have a mind to buy it.</p><p><br></p><h3>How to make it happen</h3><p>Now the problem is how to make customers want to buy it. One of the tips is to affect their brains using \"mirror neuron\", which makes you feel like doing the same when you see it or imagine it. That is why there are tons of ads and commercials on TV or the internet. It always tries to sneak into your brains and tell you to buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>What to show? It is your ideal image of you. It should be someone you want to be. Ideally, it would be the one transformed by using what you are selling. For example, if someone sees the masculine body doing an exercise at a gym on TV and you want to be like that, the commercial advertisement would have an impact on you.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n    ',\n",

But after the period of reflection, I re-think this is not something logical.

The customer started to complain how long it is going to take to achieve it. What I did is to create a algorithm from scratch, talking with domain experts, and build automated pipeline. Within one month, I achieve 95% across the given dataset.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n    ',\n",

And now I understood.&nbsp;</p><p>I need to spend additional days to read and understand this book but the point is about Teal organization.

       "  'content': '\\r\\n        <p>The legendary writer, William Zinsser. I did know him in the morning today. I was struggling to write an essay about me and needed to promote myself as an outstanding talent. I asked for a favor of one of my friends, who was very good at writing. William Zinsser and his book, \"On Writing Well\" is what he told me when I asked for the tips to improve my writing.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me summarize his seventeen essences:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Strip every sentence to its cleanest components<br>Simple is the best. Every word should be purposeful.&nbsp;</li><li>Write in the first person.&nbsp;<br>Writing is the interaction between the readers and the author. It is better for them to feel \"you.\"</li><li>Imitate&nbsp;the style of one\\'s writing you want to learn<br>Everything is starting from scratch. Sometimes I feel I just copy and paste, and not add any value when writing based on some other sources. But I just need to be mindful to learn the style intentionally.</li><li>Believe in your own identity</li><li>Don\\'t ask who your audience is...you are the audience<br>This reminds me of the post about \"the most important customer is you\" by @abrahamKim. You are the most important customer and reader.</li><li>Listen to what they write<br>This advice is actually given by my friend. He recommended me to read aloud the sentences so that we can make the rhythm but smooth sentences.</li><li>Have a habit of writing<br>Here 200WaD is the place to be. We are doing the&nbsp;right things. Also, make it right.&nbsp;</li><li>Select the single message that you wanted to leave in the readers\\' mind.&nbsp;<br>This is related to 1. We tend to add too many things into one place.&nbsp;</li><li>The first sentence is the most important.<br>If you want the reader to finish reading, you should pay attention until the end of the writing.</li><li>Use the Thesaurus<br>This is another tips and routine my friend showed me in front of me while revising my writing. I am doing the same. Whenever I find repeated words, I will try to replace by another alternative.&nbsp;</li><li>Don\\'t finish writing once. Rewrite it.<br>This is still a&nbsp;hard part for me. I did not often come back to my writing. Even I do not want to see since it is a kind of a pain if you come up with the better one and you feel like no progress. But <i>no trial, no progress</i>.&nbsp;</li><li>Go at your own pace. Your only contest is with yourself<br>Ha! This is the exact same lesson as I learned here \"compare yourself who you were yesterday.\"</li><li><p>Write down the most vivid memory.<br>In other words, you don\\'t have to look back too much to write something in the past.&nbsp;<br>\"If you still remember them it\\'s because they contain a universal truth that your readers will recognize from their own life\"&nbsp;</p></li><li><p>Write down the person\\'s actual word when writing about him or her</p></li><li><p>Look for the nearest exit when you finish your sentences</p></li><li><p>Accept the fact that it is hard to write a great sentence<br></p></li><li><p>Be proud of your writing<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></p></li></ol><p>I learned a lot through these essences. It might be weird&nbsp;but I was afraid of writing with fewer words since it seems to be too simple and not sufficient to convey my message. This is probably because I unconsciously think my thoughts are complicated (yes, because it is not organized and clear yet) and shorter sentences look poor. I need to reset my mindset and make some efforts to convey my ideas with the shortest and simplest way.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",

Another symptom is being more forgetful.&nbsp;</p><p>People might think using a smartphone could be a break for them. However, it seems not. The break you think makes you more tired.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;I personally tend to take a lot of the time when I cannot think a lot. For example,&nbsp;</p><ul><li>play the piano&nbsp;</li><li>play basketball&nbsp;</li><li>exercise&nbsp;at the gym</li></ul><p>When I was stressed so much, I needed these times not to think of annoying events or some burdens on me for a while.

Let\\'s see what is the essence of this book.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>How to create a pyramid structure&nbsp;</h3><p>If we would like to persuade someone or convey messages concisely, it would be better to use a pyramid&nbsp;approach in which we state first the main summary of a message and then explain one of elements by one. To create this structure, we should first make logically grouped sentences into a paragraph. Then we group them into a section. Finally, we summarize them into the&nbsp;entire chapter.</p><h3>How to check critically our own sentences</h3><p>Barbara said if we can critically and objectively check our own sentences, we can write better sentences. To check our own sentences, here are the things to do.</p><ul><li>Horizontal logic check: check if the order of message is correct in each group</li><li>Vertical logic check: ask what is the concrete evidence for the solutions/suggestions</li><li>Abstraction check: ask yourself what is the&nbsp;key message of what you are saying.</li><li>Expression check: ask if your expression is appropriate for stating your ideas.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul><p>The fourth check sounds difficult for me if I do not have many vocabularies and a variety of expressions.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;<br></p><p>***</p><p>Grammarly: 4</p><p>Word of the day:&nbsp;scrumptious</p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',\n",

When you train the model, we use a part of the training data to train a weak predictor and learn the mistakes. Based on this mistake, we use the lesson learned to train the next predictor to make it a bit stronger and smarter. Repeating this exercise, we will get which weak predictor has better performance in general. Then when we make the final decision, we will use this weight as balancing the result from weak learners.&nbsp;</p><p>In a way, a group of people such as organizations, companies can be a collection of neural networks i.e., human brains. We make a lot of decisions by reflecting on members\\' opinions or preference indirectly or directly. In theory, even if each member is not that smart, overall if we have enough people and a number of repetition, we have a higher chance to make a better decision than an average one.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on this meta-algorithm, many powerful algorithms have been generated such as Random Forest and Gradient&nbsp;Boosting.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I like this idea to combine the&nbsp;collective opinions and then get a&nbsp;better result.

Personally, if we can get really smooth silk tofu, you do not need anything. You can just enjoy as-is that kind of very fresh tofu. To make a slight difference, we would use a little bit of rock salt, or wasabi. In a more casual way, I love to eat tofu with bonito frakes, and a bit of shredded ginger over soy sauce.&nbsp;</p><h3><br>Edamame&nbsp;</h3><p>Edamame is a green&nbsp;whole, immature soybeans. It can be referred to as vegetable-type soybeans as well. Just boiling fresh immature soybeans, and spritz salt. Once I met with slightly-grilled edamame. It was a shocking way of eating for me but it was worth trying. Grilled scent matches with soy beans.</p><p><br></p><h3>Natto (fermented soy beans)</h3><p>Not many people like the smell and stickiness of fermented soy beans. I was also one of them when I was a little kid. However, since I ate good natto without strong smell, I got a fun of natto. It is very healthy and makes your blood so smooth in spite of such stickness..&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p>',\n",

Simply it was chopped by half. The crater was filled with syrup made with melted butter and honey. It was about right riped soft texture. Since then I recognized Avocado was a dessert to eat with something sweet. My wife did not agree with this and she regards Avocado as almost vegetable.</p><p>Recently we just tried organic Avocado from Costco with croissant, tomato, and fried scrambled egg. It was amazing. Both my wife and I was about being addictive simply because it was so tasty without adding much by hand. It was tasty as it is.

What I did for each lesson, I memorize a melody for a new part of scores by listening to teacher\\'s or public performance, and \"read\" the score piece by piece, make a sound, and adjust the sound by ear. This is far from ideal reading from sight reading perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Today I found a good sight reading article talking about some tips for piano sight reading. That article also recommends practicing first sight reading in order to improve playing the piano in general. You could imagine that those who can start to play the piano on the fly from any page wherever they open with both hands can way more efficiently improve their capability than those who first need to remember (a part of) scores before playing. On the other hand, memorizing will not be our bottleneck for practice or performance.</p><p><br></p><p>Tips for sight reading&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Positions of hands and finger</li><li>Do not read each note -&gt; Recognize them as patterns or chunks</li><li>Do not focus on one part -&gt; Use peripheral vision</li><li>Practice to follow the score according to actual performance</li><li>Map notes to positions, not characters or strings e.g., CDE or Do Re Mi</li></ul><p><br></p><p>From a computer science perspective, I found similar optimization to make sight-reading possibles by pattern recognition, which is more efficient data processing and not relying on the number of notes O(n) but O(1) if you can do.

(They) cannot complete easy tasks (since they do not find the huge returned value against the energy to be spent).\"–There are two ways to tuclke this in my mind: forget these tiny tasks and focus on more important things or complete one by one by comparing yourself to gain another indirect return, i.e., you progressed on your own.<br></li></ul><br><ul><li>Risk management for education&nbsp;<br>\"their mindset is up to what their parents allowed them to do and not to do e.g., not play using dangerous playground or athretics.\"–They have been optimized by thier parents.

I want a cool job I\\'m passionate about!\"<br>They are optimized what thier parents wants. At the same time, it might be getting difficult to get a job which can last for decates nowardays.

It is like a marathon, not a sprint. Before starting to do a job, you might not be able to tell if you have a passion or not. While doing that, you will do that under different condition or mood. Even if you have a bad condition like someone looks donw or dispise it, or you have unhealthy condition, and you can continue to do, then it might be a true \"passion\"&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p><i><br></i></p><p><i><br></i></p>',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>In a Machine Learning field, <i>Cross Validation</i>&nbsp;is a very important process. Today I will try to explain this concept with simpler terms and an example.&nbsp;</p><p>Cross Validation is an important process to ensure the model performance or the quality of learnings as the word \"validation\" says. If we say \"the model performance is good,\" we woud like to believe the model perform well in general and believe this performance test is not cheating. How can we check and ensure the quality of learning?&nbsp;</p><p>Let\\'s take an example by imagining a student, John and we are a teacher. Assuming John does not know 2 digit addition e.g., 11 + 20, 38 + 2 so we start with creating 50 exmaples of 2 digit addition as below.&nbsp;</p><p>2 + 9 = 11<br>4 + 11 = 15<br>12 + 32 = 34<br>83 + 29 = 112<br>.... etc.&nbsp;</p><p>He learned how to solve 2 digit addition. How can we test his learning if he fully understand 2 digit addition, not just remembering the pair of left parts and their answer respectively? Yes, you are right. As we grow up, we should give him \"unseen\" exercises to him and see if he can solve them or not so that we can see if he essencially understand the addition. This part is <i>validation.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Back to machine learning. In a machine learning world, we cannot easily create another new exercise since it might be computationally or economically expensive to create new one. Instead, in the above case, we just randomly pick and save 10 equations (approximately 20%) in the beginning, and let John to practice using the rest of equations (80%) repeatedly, which we call <i>training set</i>. Then we can test him using the 10 equation that we saved for testing purpose, which we call <i>test set</i>. Note that we should not have any duplicated equations in training and test set because we cannot tell if John literally memorize the answer or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Now let\\'s move on <b style=\"font-style: italic;\">\"cross\"&nbsp;</b>in Cross Validation. As a teacher, we would like to be very sure that John fully understands 2 digit addition if John can solve more than 8 out of 10 equations in a test set. However, in some cases, maybe because the test is extremely easy for him and 10 equations is almost close to 1 digit addition like 10 + 1, 10 +2, 20 + 3. To avoid this kind of lucky for John or unlucky for us, we test him with different test selection. If John were to forget everything a week later, we can test him using different training set, and see the test result by using different test set. By repeating this, we can observe if John can solve 80% of equations in a test, we can safely conclude that John learned 2 digit equations 80% accuracy.</p><p><br></p><p>There is some technically inaccurate part in the example but I hope this will help to get some intuition about cross validation. As a part of Feynman technique, I find the last part is more shaky. With this John\\'s example, it is limited to explain the repetition. I should have chosen the other example.&nbsp;</p>',\n",

In other words, based on where you are, what condition you have (what is the common sense), and what you know, if what you see is beyond what you can expect and you need the time to figure it out what is going on behind the scene, people tend to think \"oh intelligent!\"</p><p>This can be applied to not only machine or software, but also human. If one belive he or she is incrediblly intelligent or genius from the bottom of the heart, not flatter, then one cannot understand how intelligent people deal with some process or how to get such a skill.&nbsp;</p><p>Back to the contents of the article, the article described the strong AI, which is generic android type of machine and capable of many different tasks and week AI, which is focused on specific task and trained in a certain way, and concluded what AI means is up to your (readers\\') objective. In a sense, this is what I thought and different from what I expected.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",

       "  'content': '\\r\\n        <p>Since I am very forgetful, I was wondering how more effectively I can read a book. Today I met with one article talking about tips to read a business book and how to memorize the contents. In a way this content is reasonable for me because it is aligned with what I learned from \"<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Better-Mastering-Business-Anything/dp/1623365260/ref=sr_1_2?hvadid=241636439726&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvlocphy=1014243&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvrand=18441278830265643563&amp;hvtargid=kwd-279879721&amp;keywords=learn+better&amp;qid=1552623162&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-2&amp;tag=googhydr-20\">Learn Better</a>\"</p><p><br></p><p>There are 3 things to do before / during / after reading books in the article:</p><ul><li><b>Before</b> reading: find an objective or meaning. come up with some hypothesese or estimated contents based on only table of contents</li><li><b>During</b> reading: checking the estimated contents against actual conents. Identify the beggest gap between your estimate and actual, which would be a surprise for us and easily memorable in our brain.</li><li><b>After</b> reading: creating small notes to jot down the above surprised contents by a few keywords or phrase that sounds like a famous aphorism. Then based on the note, try to collect the content, and at least 5 min to hung there to recall even if you cannot. Finally, you can come back to check the actual content in the book.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>In \"Learn Better\", people cannot learn effectively if they do not find the value or meaning. So the first step before reading makes a lot of sense. The second step is&nbsp; more of a dialogue with an author, which is active activity rather than passively absorbing the contetns from the author. The third step is also important since people remember more effectively by recalling than more reading.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n    ',\n",

Still, I could not describe this moment as I wish yet. I can only end up with a superficial description... maybe I save it for later. Instead, I am writing my side story behind the miracle moment ...</p><p><br></p><p>I was sitting next to my wife lying in a bed. 2 to 4 nurses always moved around and helped the baby coming out all the way. All I can do was not to bother them.&nbsp;</p><p>Actually, I was not good at blood.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>When I was 5 years old, I fainted by looking at my sister\\'s inner ear through the microscope.&nbsp;</li><li>When I was a college student, I was about being fainted by listening to the story about&nbsp;Lasik&nbsp;surgery and imagining the situation.&nbsp;</li><li>In general, just looking at or hearing about organs or blood, especially with the situation where someone might feel acute soreness, I felt it as if I were the person and my nerve&nbsp;was getting numbed.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>This is the biggest weakness that I was not able to overcome in my life. When the labor was approaching, I needed to be very careful to avoid the situation my fainted body stayed with my wife at the life-changing moment for my&nbsp;family. Even worse, I do not want to bother the nurses and make my wife feel I&nbsp;cannot be with her especially when she needs me.&nbsp;</p><p>I told the above weakness to the nurses in advance. I can only help her at the last moment when she needed to push the baby stronger and was told \"go mad!!\" by one of the nurses. I did not see the part but only looked at her face.&nbsp;</p><p>The last challenge my wife asked me was cutting a chord. One nurse told me even those who were eager to cut a chord actually&nbsp;fainted because of the appearance of a chord. I need to have extra attention. One of my friends also told that it was harder than expected. I mentally prepared to put all of my focus on the edge of scissors and made sure there was no space between scissors. It cut smoothly. Smoother than expected. Thanks, my friend.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, I was able to help her and not bother the nurses. The nurse said \"you should be proud of it! Great job!\"&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Hiro</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n    ',\n",

We also use 'bit' to indicate very small amount like 'a little bit' or even more directly 'a bit.' But originally I assume this is coming from computer science.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Bit</h3><p>Bit is a smallest unit of information. Usually it indicates if the information exists or the information does not exists. To indicate the two status of information existence, we decided to use a number: 0 and 1. Zero (0) means nothing. One (1) means there is something.&nbsp;</p><p>Now when it is a sequence of information, we can also express such a sequence using a sequence of zero or one e.g., 01110.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Binary</h3><p>Now we saw the expression of a sequence of bit e.g., 01110. This expression is called <i>binary</i>. For each digit, there exists only 0 or 1. In our daily life, we only use <i>decimal</i>, which is another expression of information and uses from 0 to 9, in total 10 different numbers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Bit Magic</h3><p>Bit magic or bitwise algorithm means the problem is solved by taking an advantage of bit characteristics. One of the simplest example is to judege whether the number is odd or even number. If it is odd, the last digit is always odd. If it is even, the last digit is always even. So even if hundreds thousands of a sequence of bits, we only need the last digit to determine if this number is odd or even number.</p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p>\",\n",

When you use a microphone in a room&nbsp;and get too chockablock to the speaker, you might hear the extraordinary high pitch sound.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Alcoholic</h3><p>The same thing can happen if you are an&nbsp;alcoholic. When you drink a lot of alcohol, you will get a&nbsp;hangover. If you drink additional alcohol, you feel that your hangover seems to be mitigated. Your brain will learn and remember \"oh, to ease the hangover, it is better to drink more alcohol.\" Go back to the beginning of the loop.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Good Habit</h3><p>Even a good habit can fall into the same bucket. When you eat healthier food&nbsp;or do an exercise, you get the better \"feeling\", which is not necessarily a better effect on your body. Your brain receives a&nbsp;good signal and remembers \"it is better to do more!\"&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Addiction, bad habits, and good habits are a kind of similar loop but the important factor is <i>controllability</i>.

What is the lesson from this fable?—Yea, one of the typical lesson is if you work diligently, you will win. My grandfather told me a slight different lesson.&nbsp;</p><blockquote>The reason why the tortoise win is because he looks at his own goal. The rabbit looks at the tortoise.&nbsp;&nbsp;</blockquote><p>Young little Hiro said \\'I got it.

I talked to my wife and she was also interested in hosting her own blog. So we excitedly researched about rental servers, domainss, and blogging tools, all that kind of stuff. We together started to host each of blog.&nbsp;</p><p>At the end of 2018, my wife successfuly hosted two blogs and made more than 50 posts in total. On the other hand, I only had 4 half-baked posts, which I cannot stand for.&nbsp;</p><p>I did not give it up yet. I happened to see one service called, 200 Word A day. It is very simple platform for those who wants to build writing habits with two core functions: 200 words counter and streaks counter which indicates how many consecutive days you have made your post.&nbsp;</p><p>I started at Jan 3rd as a part of new year resolution, and broke the streak on Jan 5th. However, I still did not give it up. Now (Feb 20, 2019), I have <b>44 STREAKS.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Lessons</h3><p>I obtained two feedbacks which made turning points for me.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>\"compare yourself who you were yesterday\"<br>Ironically, when I wrote about \"Hare and Tortoise,\" I left one last sentences implying we need to be a hare to meet someones needs. One guy made comment on me and made me re-realize I kept unconscously comparing myself with others. The post I wrote was actually the evidence of my thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>\"still don\\'t get it\"<br>As a part of preparation for a technical blog, I tried to explain a technical concept with plain terms, which called Feynman Technique. I got the feedback for the post I made some efforts to explain Bayes Theorem, which is statistical therem, \"still don\\'t get it.\" After a bitter feelling, I was getting to appreciate his reading even if he did not get it. With the mindset \"compare yourself with who you were\", I was not scared of being judged or even critisized.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><p>Being a rabbit or tortoise. We tend to think this is deterministic. However, this could be up to the situation. It is easy to understand, but difficult to apply. We need to watch ourselves carefully.

       "  'content': '\\r\\n        <p>This post is about Beethoven as the 2nd post about outstanding composers. (1st post: <a href=\"https://200wordsaday.com/words/fredric-chopin-94575c6a4cc00e81f\">Frederic Chopin</a>) By writing a summary of their life and findings intersection in their lives, I would like to weave my relation map among composers.&nbsp;</p><p>Through playing his scores and his frown face in his portrait, I had the impression that he has strong character, and some difficulties in his life.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Beethoven vs Chopin</h3><p>Beethoven was born in 1770 in Germany, which is about 250 years ago and 40 years before Chopin was born. Bethoven was died in 1827 so there is 17 years overlap between Chopin and Beethoven. Like Chopin\\'s family, Beethoven\\'s family is also music family—his father was tenor singer at the loyal palace.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, he did not have great family environment. Beethoven\\'s father is addictive to alcohol and tends to lakc of mony. almost abused him by giving harsh music education when he was 4 years old. He was getting a feeling of disgust about music. When he was 20 years old, he was getting deaf and amost thought of suiside at his 32.&nbsp;</p><h3><br>Beethoven\\'s Scores</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4591dCHe_sE\">Moonlight Sonata (Piano Sonata No. 14)</a>: this was completed in 1801 when he was 31 years old before he started to lose his listening capability.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8fxbHPwVHg\">For Elise</a>: this is one of the most popular classic score for beginners. This was composed in 1810 as the same time for Moonlinght Sonata. This score was not published 40 years after his death. It is one of his mysteries who is \"Elise.\"&nbsp; One of the hypothesis said Elise was misspelled for Therese, who Beethoven was supposed to propose to.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuxtYBMDBVs\">A Therese</a> (Piano Sonata No.24 in F#, Op.78): there is another score which has nickname \"Therese.\"&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br></p><h3>Side Notes</h3><ul><li>Op.: \"Opus\" is the numbering assigned to music works. Beethoven wrote a lot of \"Piano Sonata\". To distinguish them, composers assigned the number to the scores.&nbsp;</li><li>Sonata: we might hear a lot \"sonata\" but I was not clear what exactly means. The definition of sonata is just a pieace of classical music that consists of several parts. The origin of \"Sonata\" is Italy, and it means \"Played\" or \"Sounded\" by some instruments in Italy while \"Cantata\" means \"Sung scores.\"</li></ul><p>Beethoven seems to be influenced by Mozart when he was a little. So I will move on Mozart on the next post.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>- Hiro</p><p>***&nbsp;</p><p>Grammarly:0</p><p>Word of the day:&nbsp;disavow -&gt; no use</p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",

Today I would like to summarize his life to deepen the understanding of his music. Especially I am curious how he built his capapability and how he composed his scores, what was his intentions in his pieces.&nbsp;</p><p>It was about 210 year ago. Chopin was born in 1810 in Poland. He started to seriously practice playing the piano under the guidance of a piano master when he was 6 years old. Luckly his family is good at playing music—his father can play flute and violin, and his mother can play the piano. But with just one year, he already caught up with his master, and then perfromed a public recital. At the same time, he also started to compose the score.&nbsp;</p><p>He had not only a greatest talent but also encouragous masters, who tried <i>not to push their narrow-mind, out-dated way</i> to Chopin but respect and raise <i>as he wants</i>.&nbsp; How outstanding was his capability? According to his biographer, Zdzisław Jachimecki, he was different from any of famous composer like Bach, Mozart, or Beethoven, who was a biginner when they were a little.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Here are the famous scores he wrote:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0Y1WvaK4sQ\">Dog Waltz </a>(Op. 64, No 1): this was gifted for the lady Chopin started to show his interest after his proposal was rejected to another women, Maria because of his health condition.<br></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9E6b3swbnWg\">Nocturne</a> (Op.9 No.2): this was composed when he was around 20 years old.&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0GIvbg4P4Ko\">Fantasia-Improvviso</a>&nbsp;(Op. 66): this was composed in 1834 when he was around 24 years old but was not published. As one of the hypothesis, it was very similar to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZZ3-YU2o6g\">Beethoven\\'s Moonlight Sonata.&nbsp;</a><br></p></li></ul><p>I wish I could know more about what kind of intentions he implmented in his scores. But it is not deeply enough to search this time.</p><p>- Hiro</p><p>***&nbsp;</p><p>Grammarly: 0</p><p>Word of the day:&nbsp;prestigious</p>\\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",

Not many gets up and come to school at 6AM and sacrifice their sleep.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of lack of sleep, you will not be as tall as you want to be and lose the productive time in the morning during lectures.&nbsp;</p><p>Again let me emphasize the point. Find a better way to improve yourself, not just by doing a lot or spending more time. There is a pitfall of doing a lot. You might just end up with being satisfied by yourself.</p><p>Of course, you did a great job and learned from it. Thanks to your continuation, I am still playing basketball, which helps me to make great friends in a foreign country. You will learn what you are not good at. Your consistency and diligence will be powerfull and your asset in your future.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>2. Be yourself</p><p class=\"\">School is a confined place so I can understand you paid attention for how others look at you and think of you. However, it will be more important that you can persuit for your own goal by comparing yourself who you were yestereday later. There is no \"too late\" to start something. You are afraid of being critisized by others or bullied. You will be fine. You should be just as you want and <b>be yourself</b>.&nbsp;</p><p>I wrote above the advice but overall, I really appreciate your efforts and diligence. Thansk to that, I am doing well and got married with one great woman, which you are always worried. You will keep making your choice right.&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, please spend the time with your family.

Let me try to explain \"Heap\" as plain as possible.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><h3>Tree</h3><p>Before going to explain heap, we actually need to know \"tree\" based data structure, where each information is connected like a tree, which consists of 2 components: a node and an edge. This is very useful to explain the hierarchical relationship like country, state, and county.</p><p>For example, United States of America has 50 states. Each state has multiple counties. In this case, we can think of the following tree structure. The most left is the highest level in this tree.</p><p>USA - Alabama - County A&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- County B</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Alaska&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- County C</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- County D</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;- County E</p><p><br></p><h3>Heap</h3><p>So now let\\'s go back to \"Heap.\" \"Heap\" is a type of tree meeting with the following certain conditions:</p><ol><li>each node has only but always two nodes</li><li>each node has a number information</li><li>a higher node has always bigger&nbsp;or always smaller  number.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br></li></ol><p>For example, there is a three-layer tree where each node has a number as below.</p><p>1 - 2 - 5<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - 8<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;- 4 - 7<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - 10</p><p>The top layer is the node with 1, which has two nodes meeting with Condition 1. All of the nodes has the number information, which meets with Condition 2. Last but not least, the higher node, 1 is bigger than either of nodes blongs to 1. The same rule can be applied for node 2 and 4 since their nodes has bigger values.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>*****&nbsp;</p><p>Feynman techniques is working well. The decomposing the abstruse word into plain can be the process of understanding. In addition, I can remember more clearly what is the concept of topics.

Whenever I took the role of a werewolf, I got nervous and felt my heartbeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Before watching this, here is my empirical intuition to spot a liar.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>a smile is a bit awkward&nbsp;</li><li>less eye contact</li><li>a topic is a bit different from usual</li></ol><p>Basically, I am somehow sensing a liar from unusual behaviors.</p><p><br></p><p>Pamela mentioned the followings:</p><ol><li>More formal &amp; distancing language from the subject<br>She took an example of Bill Clinton\\'s claim. He used&nbsp;non-contracted denial&nbsp;i.e., \"I <b>did not</b> have sexual&nbsp;relationships\" and \"<b>that</b> woman\", which made more distance from the subject.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></li><li>Look an eye a little bit too much<br>People already know looking at the eyes indicates honesty, so liars tend to actually look at the eyes.&nbsp;</li><li>Fake smile<br>People can create a fake smile but cannot control the botox around eyes.&nbsp;</li><li>Attitude<br>When you talk with&nbsp;a suspect, he/she is ready to talk but usually not train the behavior. If the suspect was asked to talk about the sequence of events in reverse-chronological order, he/she will show some strange behavior.

If she was in a good mood, she is \"going out\" with 80% probability, 8 times out of 10 times. On the other hand, if she was in a bad mood, she is \"staying home\" with 70% chances, 7 times out of 10 times. Overall she is in a good mood&nbsp;with 90%. In this setting, if you see your mom is coming from outside and see she was going out, how likely do you think she was and is in a good mood?&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The event of&nbsp; \"she is going out\"&nbsp;8 / 10 and \"in a good mood\"&nbsp; 9/10 = 72 / 100<br></li><li>The event of \"she is going out\" 8 / 10 but \"in a bad mood\" 1 - 9/10 = 8 / 100</li></ul><p>So if you add up the two type of events, the chance of \"going out\" is 72 / 100 + 8/100 = 80/100.&nbsp;</p><p>Within this event, the ratio of the even when she is in a good mood\" or \"in a bad mood\" is (72/100) ➗ (80/100) = 72/80 = 9/10. So you see that she was going out, more likely she is in a good mood. Does it match with your intuition?&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>I hope my kid will understand with this explanation.</p><p>When reading my writing above, the shaky area or one using a lot of technical terms is around probability and math. Also, I can add a more good explanation for how to calculate the ratio of she was going out.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Let me know where you think the shaky area is.</p><p>- Hiro</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>Today I found the interesting video about 5 learning phases to learn American accents by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rachelsenglish.com/accent-training-the-5-phases/\">Rachel</a>&nbsp;as the way a baby does potty training. Let me summarize the 5 phases and apply this to writing skill.&nbsp;</p><p>Rachel explained 5 phases to change a pronunciation habit.&nbsp;<br></p><ol><li>Total unawareness<br>The first step is to start with nothing. You do not know where to pee and you just did it without knowing if it is the right place or not. Even if we learn about English, we never learn only pronunciation how to pronounce a specific sound or how to express the sentence with a certain tone.&nbsp;</li><li>Consciousness &amp; past<br>The next step is to be aware and know what was the right way. You are understanding what is peeing, and where was the right place to pee. By definition, description, you understand how you should make a sentence. You could also notice what mistake you made in the past or find it when you listen to your recording.&nbsp;</li><li>Consciousness &amp; present<br>The third step is to notice the mistake when it is happening. You are aware of peeing while you are doing. While you are pronouncing the word or phrases during the conversation, you notice you made mistakes or fall back to your accent.&nbsp;</li><li>Consciousness &amp; future<br>The fourth step is to predict the mistake when it is coming. You can tell the parents when it is coming like \"I\\'m going to pee.\" Now you can know you are pronouncing something you might make a mistake so you will pay a lot of attention for it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Unconsciously do<br>The last step is to do it as you do without any attention. Now it is a part of your habit. You will go pee by yourself. You can speak and talk almost like a native without thinking.</li></ol><p><br></p><p>Whenever I provided a speech in Toastmaster, I received feedback related to pronunciation and phrasing. I am not a native speaker and if I did not pay attention or spend the time for accent, my accent gets degraded and closer to my mother tongue.&nbsp;</p><p>What I like Rachel\\'s approach is that this is broken down into the reasonable size of steps and helps me to understand where I am. This can be also applied to mastering another difficult thing in writing like native-like writing.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>- Hiro&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>',\n",

Yes, I think I have heard about this kind of person from one of my best friend in the context of political correctness and hottest tweets.&nbsp;</p><p>According to some of articles and blogs about him, he is very capable of wording and logical discussion, and courageous, realistic, but humble.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I will read his books and watch some of his youtube&nbsp;movies.

Our brain is working and thinking of various things. Every day there is a noise on your ideas and opinions based on your health condition, and what you do on that day. However, if you keep pushing snapshots of what you <i>are thinking, </i>it is helpful to observe what is the mainstream of your thoughts.

This problem was called \"Secretary problem.\" </p><p>If you have a 100 candidates for your secretary position, you do not know who is the best talent for your secretary. When you start to see the first few candidates, you are getting ideas who are better and worse. For the last few candidates, you already know what is the quality that you could get out of this talent pool but less likely you could find better person out of the last few candidates. You might already inclined in the past.</p><p>To have a good balance and close to the mathematical solution, you can see 37% of the candidates first to build your reference or benchmark. After that, whenever you find the \"best\" person based on your benchmark, this is the person you need to choose. </p><p>This can be applied to finding many areas such as your spouse, house, employees, etc. </p><p>2. Tactics: spare your brain space by documentation</p><p>To execute this plan, you need to note down key information about houses otherwise your brain will be overwhelmed by a lot of new information and your brain might give up. I am done. I write down the following key indicators for each places in google spread sheet: area, price, price/square, commute time,  </p><p>   </p><p>Last but not least, there is no perfect house. There is always missing pieces you compromised. However that would be the next opportunity that you are aiming to get in a new place. </p><p>What is your tips when finding a new place.</p><p>-Hiro</p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n    ',\n",

If one cannot come up with an appropriate word, the word was already said by others or it is too slow to ride on the rhythm, the one loss. The loser will start the next round by giving a new category and so on.</p><p>For example, let\\'s say we have 6 people and the first person gives the theme \"animal.\" Then the following person says \\'elephant\\', the next will do with \\'monkey\\', and so on over rhythmical claps.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The tip for this game is very simple. Before your turn comes, you need to come up with at least <b>TWO</b> words in your mind. Even if your previous person takes one of your words right before your turn, you can choose the other one.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>For 200wordaday, if we can have at least two posts as a draft, you can keep your streaks.

During that time, rental movie or TV show was popular but I cannot afford to rent by myself.&nbsp;<br>I was so excited&nbsp;and asked her recommendation, which was \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" I could not forget the very first experience of watching the movie at school. Not only that, the quality of the movie was so impressive. Even if I was high school students, I learned the power of continuation and even if you are in a very bad situation or environment like jail, we should find a hope that you can continue to believe.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0133093/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1\">The Matrix (1999)</a><br>This was also so popular at that time thanks to the famous scene where&nbsp;Keanu Reeves is bending&nbsp;backward and avert the bullets. This was the first sci-fi movie that gave me the idea that there might be some possibility of \"Oracle\" or \"Big Brother,\" who designed our world and monitor us. After that, I try to ask myself if I was blind and tamed by the system or any way to find a&nbsp;way to out.</li></ol><p>This will be continued.

       "  'content': 'Last March I joined <a href=\"https://www.toastmasters.org/\">Toastmaster</a>, which is an international organization to provide a supportive community for us to improve our leadership and communication.&nbsp;<br><p><br></p><p>As Toastmaster is systematically very organized, there might be a lot of hints for 200wordsaday to build a supportive community for <b>writing</b>. Here is the list of things we could apply or translate some essence from Toastmaster to 200wordsaday.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>Context - we have a 1-hour weekly session within a 10-20 people group, which consists of 2 sessions: prepared and improvised speech. In addition, there are a couple supportive roles assigned to some attendees. Today let me translate some roles in Toastmaster to 200wordsaday.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><b>Grammarian</b><br>He/she will take notes for good phrases or grammatically incorrect expression and report at the end of the session. In 200wordsaday, not as a random person or follower, it would be nice to make a comment as \"<i>grammarian</i>\" label (I imagine that we could select it from a drop-down list) and share some grammatical feedbacks with the author. In turn, the author could also disclose the preference by displaying which kind of feedback is welcomed. I strongly would like to label my post with \"<i>I need grammarian</i>\", which means I am always welcome to be pointed out grammatical feedback.&nbsp;<br><br>In addition, he/she will set \\'<i style=\"\">word of the day</i>\\' and count on how many times attendees can have the chance to use the word. Typically \\'<i>word of the day</i>\\' is not a daily word but a bit difficult one and meant to improve our vocabulary. If we have \\'word of today\\' in 200daysaword, it would be fun to compete by&nbsp;using that word.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><b>Ah-counter</b><br>She/he will count various kinds of fillers like<i> \\'ah-\\', \\'eh\\', \\'mm\\', \\'and\\', \\'you know\\' \\'like\\', \\'so\\'</i>, etc. As @davidnge posted about \"<a href=\"https://200wordsaday.com/words/improve-your-writing-by-removing-redundant-words-23665c2eb845514b9\">improving&nbsp;your writing by removing redundant words</a>\", someone could wear the hat for \"ah-counter\" when making a comment in 200wordsaday and leave some counts of redundant words in terms of good writing.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><b>Evaluator</b><br>In Toastmaster, it is also a part of objectives to support each other and essential&nbsp;skills to share constructive feedback. Evaluators will assess prepared speeches from behavioral and structural aspects. If we can also build certain guidance and formulate good feedbacks cycles in a 200wordsaday community, it would be very beneficial in a long run for writers. While there are multiple writing styles and each of authors\\' objectives varies, we can prepare different guidance for each path such as a&nbsp;journal, technical, personal, poet, instrumental, critic.&nbsp;<br><br></li><li><b>Improvised speech</b><br>For a&nbsp;prepared speech session, you will be given a different topic or theme for your own level for prepared speech. On the other hand, improvised speech is the ad-lib speech where a topic master throws some questions, and one of the attendees voluntarily show up and instantly start to speak about the question.&nbsp; Similarly, in 200wordsaday, we could have some prompt writing session within a limited time.&nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul><p>Any attractive features we could add to 200wordsday?&nbsp;</p><p>- Hiro</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\r\\n        \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",

       "  'content': '\\n        <p>Next week we are moving to new place. One has more hustle for packing and unpacking as one has more stuff. Luckly this time I am so comfortable to move on new place in contrast to the previous time when I moved to the current place.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is two tips I learned from \"<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2FcRgmg\">The Life-changing Magic of Tidying Up</a>\" written by Kondo Mari, who is a Japanese lady who was selected as Fotune under 400. Now she has <a href=\"https://www.sparkjoypodcast.com/\">podcast</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/title/80209379\">Netflix</a>.<br></p><p>1. Order matters</p><p>We should start with 1. clothes 2. books, 3. papers, 4. miscellenious, and 5 memorial things. Starting with clothes is especially important since it is relatively easiler to judge the second point. As we deal with 4 categories, we are getting more comfortable to deal with the most difficult things to discard i.e., memorial things.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Process matters</p><p>We should first gather and collect all items for one category (mentioned above e.g., clothes) from all rooms into one place. Then pick one by one, and ask yourself if that item \"spark your joy\" or not. If not, we appreciate and say \"thank you &amp; good bye\" to this item.&nbsp;</p><p>When I moved to current place, I conducted decluttering based on these tips and now it is so easy to keep my stuff organized. I strongly recommend to try one of these tips from Kon Mari.&nbsp;</p><p>- Hiro</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p><br></p>\\n    ',\n",

       "  'content': '<p>I would like to be a good learner and always wanted to be a good writer.&nbsp;But I kept failing. In 2018, I ended up writing only 8 half-baked blog posts.&nbsp;</p><p>However, this year should be different from the last year. One of the best books I have read in 2018 is \\'<i><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Fdb3C5\">Learn Better</a></i>\\' written by&nbsp;Ulrich Boser. Here are the key essences:&nbsp;<br></p><p>1. Finding your <b>value</b>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Setting<b> a feasible goal for a process</b></p><p>3. Getting the right <b>feedback</b></p><p>4. <b>Ask yourself</b> and explain what you learned</p><p>5. Find <b>relation and analogy</b> with what you already know&nbsp;</p><p>Before starting to learn, we should spend a little bit of time on why you would like to learn the \"thing.\" Then the bigger target would be better to be split into smaller but feasible goals for a process. Getting the appropriate feedback in the right timing helps us not to be stuck and keep us moving forward. We need to talk more to ourselves to deepen our understanding to check if you really understand and what you understood. To convert the fact you just know to your knowledge and wisdom, you need to anchor and embed the fact to your body by finding some relationship between new and old knowledge.&nbsp;</p><p>Being a good writer is important to me since I would like to be an&nbsp;author of a book and a CEO to share my thoughts with&nbsp;all employees in the future. Also, I would like to overcome my complex that I am not good at writing. A feasible goal for a process is to write a post here in <i>200wordsaday. </i>Hopefully, I could get some feedback from you and I&nbsp;would like to help you to grow as well to&nbsp;create a better community here as a member of 200wordsaday. It would be great if any of you could leave constructive feedback here. To learn the way of learning from \\'Learn Better\\', I talked myself what I learned from it and summarized it as mentioned above.&nbsp;</p><p>- Hiro</p><p><br></p>\\r\\n    \\r\\n    \\r\\n    ',\n",
