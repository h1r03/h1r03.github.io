<p>Hi, this is h1ros (Hiro [hɪɹo]) has a passion about data science, machine learning, deep learning, and computer science. </p>
<p>I will appreciate if you make any comments. </p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<p>Through explaining the concept, theories, technologies, technique, and tools to myself and others in this blog, I would like to deepen my knowledge and expertise (following the lessons from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Better-Mastering-Business-Anything-ebook/dp/B01IIQQF10/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=learn+better&amp;qid=1551251923&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-2">Learn Better</a> and <a href="https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model">Feynman Technique</a>. I will be glad that anyone see this would be helpful in any aspect. </p>
<h2>Post Categories</h2>
<p><strong>Coding</strong></p>
<p>Every Saturday, I join the weekly contest at LeetCode. I will write about some problems that I could not solve or I did not solve well. </p>
<p><strong>Machine learning</strong></p>
<p>I will refer to good materials like <a href="https://chrisalbon.com/">Chris Albon's website</a> and find a good topic to explain for myself. I only look at the title (perhaps browse the contents for a second) to get some ideas but not copying the contents. Then I will write the contents about machine learning on my own. </p>
<p><strong>Open Source</strong></p>
<p>I woud like to contribute to one of the open source projects. I will write about the process and experiments for open source. I will be very happy if you have any recommendation / suggestion / guidance about open source contribution. </p>
<h2>Motto</h2>
<ul>
<li>Compare yourself with who your were yesterday</li>
<li>Open to any suggestion</li>
</ul>
