Hi, this is h1ros (Hiro [hɪɹo]) has a passion about data science, machine learning, deep learning, and computer science. 

I will appreciate if you make any comments. 


## Objectives 
Through explaining the concept, theories, technologies, technique, and tools to myself and others in this blog, I would like to deepen my knowledge and expertise (following the lessons from [Learn Better](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Better-Mastering-Business-Anything-ebook/dp/B01IIQQF10/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=learn+better&qid=1551251923&s=books&sr=1-2) and [Feynman Technique](https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model). I will be glad that anyone see this would be helpful in any aspect. 

## Post Categories

**Coding**

Every Saturday, I join the weekly contest at LeetCode. I will write about some problems that I could not solve or I did not solve well. 

**Machine learning**

I will refer to good materials like [Chris Albon's website](https://chrisalbon.com/) and find a good topic to explain for myself. I only look at the title (perhaps browse the contents for a second) to get some ideas but not copying the contents. Then I will write the contents about machine learning on my own. 

**Open Source**

I woud like to contribute to one of the open source projects. I will write about the process and experiments for open source. I will be very happy if you have any recommendation / suggestion / guidance about open source contribution. 



## Motto

* Compare yourself with who your were yesterday
* Open to any suggestion
