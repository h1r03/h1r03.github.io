Hi, this is h1ros (Hiro [hɪɹo]) has a passion about data science, machine learning, deep learning, and computer science. 

Thank you for visiting my website. I will appreciated you drop any comments using your precious time. 


## Objectives 
Through explaining the concept, theories, technologies, technique, and tools to myself and others in this blog, I would like to deepen my knowledge and expertise (following the lessons from [Learn Better](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Better-Mastering-Business-Anything-ebook/dp/B01IIQQF10/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=learn+better&qid=1551251923&s=books&sr=1-2) and [Feynman Technique](https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model). I will be glad that anyone see this would be helpful in any aspect. 

## Routine
Every Saturday, I join the weekly contest at LeetCode. I will write about some problems that I could not solve or I did not solve well. 

## Motto
* I compare myself with who I was yesterday to progress. 
* I am open to any feedback or critisism. I will appreciate your precious time for reading my posts.
