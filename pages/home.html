		<h3>Motivation</h3>
		<p>Through explaining the concept, theories, technologies, technique, and tools to myself and others in this blog, I would like to deepen my knowledge and expertise (following the lessons from Learn Better and Feynman Technique. I will be glad that anyone see this would be helpful in any aspect. </p>

      <p>I did not take any formal computer science education and started to reseach about machine learning. However, I felt coding problem and data structure would be the fundamental skill for data science as well. </p>
      <p>Every Sturday I join LeetCode Weekly Contest and deepen my understanding by explaining some problems that I could not solve nicely<p>

      <p>To improve writing skill and organize my thoughts, everyday I write more broader topics about what I am thinking in <a href="https://200wordsaday.com/" title="200 Words a Day"></a>, and explain what I would like to understand more especially the following topics.<p>
