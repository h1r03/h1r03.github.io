Hi, this is h1ros (Hiro), which sounds like Hero [hɪɹoʊ], a data scientist and has a passion about data science, machine learning, deep learning, and computer science. 


## Objectives 
Through explaining the concept, theories, technologies, technique, and tools to myself and others in this blog, I would like to deepen my knowledge and expertise (following (Learn better)[https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Better-Mastering-Business-Anything-ebook/dp/B01IIQQF10/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=learn+better&qid=1551251923&s=books&sr=1-2] and (Feynman Technique)[https://mattyford.com/blog/2014/1/23/the-feynman-technique-model]). I will be glad that anyone see this would be helpful in any aspect. 

## Motto
* I compare myself with who I was yesterday to progress
* I do NOT intend to obtain others' approval or `like`, but I am open to any feedback or critisism. Even comments like "I still do not understad" or "does not make sense" would be welcomed. First of all I will appreciate your time for reading my posts.
