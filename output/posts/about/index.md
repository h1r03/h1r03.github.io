Hi, this is h1ros (Hiro), which sounds like Hero [hɪɹoʊ], a data scientist and has a passion about data science, machine learning, deep learning, and computer science. 

Through this blog, I would like to deepen my extertise by explaining to myself and others (following Learn better and Feynman Technique). I will be glad that anyone see this would be helpful in any aspect. 


### Objectives
* I compare myself with who I was yesterday to progress
* I do NOT intend to obtain others' approval or `like`, but I am open to any feedback or critisism. "I still do not understad" or "does not make sense" would be alsowelcomed. I appreciate your time for reading my sentences.
